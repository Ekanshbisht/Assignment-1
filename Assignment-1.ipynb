    "(i) / (Division Operator):\n",
    "The division operator is used to divide one number by another. It performs floating-point division, which means it returns a floating-point result.\n",

    "Q4. Create a list of length 10 of your choice containing multiple types of data. Using for loop print the\n",
    "element and its data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    " Here's an example of creating a list of length 10 with different types of data and printing each element along with its data type using a for loop:\n",
    " \n",
    " my_list = [1, 'apple', 3.14, True, [1, 2, 3], 'banana', 5, False, (1, 2, 3), 'orange']\n",

    "False <class 'bool'>\n",
    "(1, 2, 3) <class 'tuple'>\n",
    "orange <class 'str'>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the my_list variable is a list of length 10 that contains elements of different types, such as integers, strings, floats, booleans, lists, and tuples.

    "Q5. Using a while loop, verify if the number A is purely divisible by number B and if so then how many\n",
    "times it can be divisible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Here's an example of using a while loop to verify if number A is divisible by number B and, if so, counting how many times it can be divided:\n",
    "\n",
    "A = 120\n",
    "B = 6\n",
    "count = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "while A % B == 0:\n",

    "    count += 1\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "output:\n",
    "\n",
    "Number A can be divided by number B 2 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have number A as 120 and number B as 6. The while loop checks if A is divisible by B by checking if the remainder of A divided by B is 0. If it is, it means A is divisible by B, and the loop continues. Inside the loop, A is divided by B, and the count variable keeps track of how many times A has been divided by B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the condition A % B != 0 is met, the loop stops, and we print the number of times A was divisible by B using the count variable. In this case, 120 can be divided by 6 two times evenly.\n",

    "Q7. What do you understand about mutable and immutable data types? Give examples for both showing\n",
    "this property.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "In programming, mutable and immutable are terms used to describe whether an object's value can be changed after it is created. Here's an explanation of mutable and immutable data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutable Data Types:\n",
    "Mutable data types are those that can be modified or changed after they are created. This means you can update, add, or remove elements of a mutable object without creating a new object.\n",
    "Examples of mutable data types in Python include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists: Lists can be modified by adding or removing elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "my_list.append(4)  # Add an element\n",
    "my_list.remove(2)  # Remove an element\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries: Dictionaries can have key-value pairs added, removed, or modified.\n",
    "python\n",
    "my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25}\n",
    "my_dict['age'] = 26  # Modify a value\n",
    "my_dict['city'] = 'New York'  # Add a new key-value pair\n",
    "del my_dict['name']  # Remove a key-value pair\n",
    "print(my_dict)  # Output: {'age': 26, 'city': 'New York'}\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable Data Types:\n",
    "Immutable data types, on the other hand, cannot be changed after they are created. If you need to modify an immutable object, you have to create a new object.\n",
    "Examples of immutable data types in Python include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings: Strings cannot be modified in-place; you need to create a new string.\n",
    "\n",
    "my_string = \"Hello\"\n",
    "new_string = my_string + \" World\"  # Concatenate strings\n",
    "print(my_string)  # Output: \"Hello\"\n",
    "print(new_string)  # Output: \"Hello World\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples: Tuples are similar to lists, but they are immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "# Trying to modify a tuple will result in an error\n",
    "# my_tuple[0] = 4  # Raises an error\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable objects ensure data integrity and are useful in situations where you want to guarantee that an object's value remains unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding the concept of mutable and immutable data types, you can make informed decisions on which type to use based on your program's requirements.\n",
